# Project1

## Motivation

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.


The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

•	Listings, including full descriptions and average review score

•	Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments

•	Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day



In This Project, we answer 3 questions:

1.	The busiest month in terms of availbility of listing

2.	The highest mean price per night of listings

3.	The most expensive in terms of 'accomodate'



In Order to answer these questions , we will use:

•	Calendar.csv

•	listings.csv




## Libraries

Numpy – Pandas – Seaborn – Matplotlib




## Summary of results

The months with the highest availability correspond to the months of Christmas (November and December). January is the month with the lowest availability followed by the summer months (July and August)

The highest average price per night, we find it in the summer months (June, July and August), which coincide with those with less availability. It makes sense, since the lower the offer, the higher the price

The average price per accommodates, we can see that between 1-7 pax, the relationship is direct. But from there no, being 11 pax the highest average price, that is more high than a 16 pax accomodation
